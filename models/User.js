// This code defines a Mongoose schema for a User model with fields for name, email, and password.
// It includes pre-save middleware to hash the password before saving it to the database and a method to compare passwords.
// The schema is then exported as a Mongoose model for use in other parts of the application.
// This code is essential for user authentication and management in a web application.
// It ensures that passwords are securely hashed and provides a method for verifying user credentials during login.
// The code also includes error handling for MongoDB connection issues.
// This is important for maintaining the integrity and security of user data.
// The use of bcrypt for hashing passwords is a standard practice in web development.
// It helps protect user passwords from being exposed in case of a data breach.
// The schema also includes timestamps for tracking when a user was created or updated.
// This can be useful for auditing and managing user accounts.
// Overall, this code is a crucial part of the backend for user management in a web application.
